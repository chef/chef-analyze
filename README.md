## Installation

We highly recommend using [Chef Workstation](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-workstation/), which includes
chef-analyze out of the box. If for some reason you can't use Chef Workstation you can manually install the
[Habitat package `chef/chef-analyze`](https://bldr.habitat.sh/#/pkgs/chef/chef-analyze/latest).

```bash
hab pkg install -b chef/chef-analyze
```

## Development Documentation

The development of this CLI is being done inside a [Chef Habitat Studio](https://www.habitat.sh/docs/glossary/#glossary-studio),
you will need to have [Chef Habitat installed](https://www.habitat.sh/docs/install-habitat/) on your local workstation
to proceed with any development task.

### Building

From within a Chef Habitat Studio, you can build the chef-analyze CLI by:

1. Building a native Habitat package.
    ```
    $ hab studio enter
    [1][default:/src:0]# build
    ```
2. Helper method to build cross-platform binaries.
    ```
    $ hab studio enter
    [1][default:/src:0]# build_cross_platform
    ```
    __NOTE:__ The generated binaries will be located inside the `bin/` directoy.

### Testing

From within a Chef Habitat Studio, you can run both, unit and integration tests:
1. Unit tests. ([Go-based](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/))
    ```
    $ hab studio enter
    [1][default:/src:0]# unit_tests
    ```
2. Integration tests. ([Go-based](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/))
    ```
    $ hab studio enter
    [1][default:/src:0]# integration_tests
    ```
    __NOTE:__ The integration tests require a binary to test against, this helper automatically triggers
    a cross-platform build and uses the generated binary for the running platform.

### Code coverage
This repository requires any change to always increase, or at least, maintain the percentage of code
coverage, to execute the current coverage run:
```
$ hab studio enter
[1][default:/src:0]# code_coverage
```
For details about the code coverage open the generated HTML report located at `coverage/coverage.html`.

### Patching a local Chef Workstation Install
You can override the `chef-analyze` binary that comes inside your local Chef Workstation install by
running `make patch_local_workstation` at the top level folder of this repository. Then just simply
run `chef-analyze` or `chef analyze` to use the top-level chef wrapper.
